VAGAO comes from the Spanish-inspired word “Vagua”, which for me means SWAG ON.
“Swag On” isn’t just a style — it’s my daily affirmation. Every day I remind myself to walk with confidence, no matter what.

Before I found my swag, I used to be bullied. I felt invisible, like I didn’t belong. But owning my swag gave me power — it became my armor, my confidence, my freedom.

VAGAO represents that transformation: from being overlooked, to being unapologetically seen.
It’s not just streetwear. It’s a statement for everyone who ever felt underestimated.

When you wear VAGAO, you’re not just wearing clothes. You’re saying: “I’ve got my swag on. I own who I am.
